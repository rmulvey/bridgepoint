=== Association Editor 

A new association editor is added to BridgePoint UML Editor.  It allows the user
to populate the details of a relationship as the association is drawn on the
canvas.  The editor supports automatic formalization as well as configuration
of referentials, role phrases, conditionality, and multiplicity.
