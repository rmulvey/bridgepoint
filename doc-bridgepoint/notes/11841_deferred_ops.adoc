= Support deferred operations in BridgePoint (part 1)

xtUML Project Implementation Note

== 1 Abstract

Deferred operations are supported in MASL and there is desire for them to be
supported by xtUML/OAL.  Additionally, the Ciera model compiler (which is
itself an xtUML/OAL model) uses them. Up to this point, they have been
maintained by hand, but this feature will give them official support within
BridgePoint.

== 2 Introduction and Background

Original analysis note found at <<dr-1>>.

Ciera project found at <<dr-2>>.

== 3 Requirements

These requirements are a modified subset of the requirements proposed in the
original analysis note <<dr-1>>.

3.1 BridgePoint shall supply a CME to mark an instance based operation as a deferred operation.  +
3.1.1 The option to mark an operation as a deferred operation shall be available only if the following conditions are met:  +
3.1.1.1 The operation is not already a deferred operation.  +
3.1.1.2 The operation is an instance based operation.  +
3.1.1.3 The class on which the operation is defined is participating as a supertype in at least one subsuper association.  +
3.1.2 BridgePoint shall allow the user to choose which supsuper association to defer the operation across.  +
3.1.2.1 BridgePoint shall only allow an operation to defer across one supsuper association at a given time.  +
3.1.3 BridgePoint shall allow the user to choose whether the deferral is "required" or "optional".  +
3.2 BridgePoint shall supply a CME to mark a deferred to operation as local (non-deferred).  +
3.2.1 The option to mark an operation as a local operation shall be available only if the operation is already marked as deferred.  +
3.3 Details of deferrals applied to operations shall be visible in the Properties view.  +
3.4 Ciera shall support deferred operation behavior.  +
3.4.1 If a deferred operation is invoked, the subtype of the current instance shall be selected and the operation on the subtype instance shall be invoked.  +
3.4.1.1 If there is no subtype instance related, Ciera shall throw an error.  +
3.4.1.2 If the deferred operation is marked "optional" and there is no deferred to operation in the subtype instance, the deferred operation itself shall be executed.  +
3.4.2 Deferred to operations shall be invocable directly.  +
3.4.3 Deferred operations which return values, have parameters, or use array types shall be supported.  +

== 4 Work Required

4.1 Model deferral

`O_DEF` was added to the Subsystem subsystem as shown in the BridgePoint diagram
in the analysis note <<dr-1>>. Another attribute "required" was added to capture
whether or not the deferred operation requires each subtype to provide an
implementation.

4.2 CMEs

`MakeDeferred` and `MakeLocal` CMEs were introduced along with corresponding
operations on `O_TFR` and action filter (to determine when the CMEs are
visible). PEI data was updated for the new CMEs.

4.3 Persistence

The new `O_DEF` class was added to the persistence tree PEI data as a child of
`O_TFR`.

4.4 Properties

The appropriate PEI data was updated to include deferrals in the properties view

4.5 OOA schema

The schema was updated to include `O_DEF`.

== 5 Implementation Comments

5.1 An MC-Java bug was fixed in the process. The bug was that enumerator values
were generated starting at 1 and not 0. This is not consistent with MC-3020 (and
other model compiler tools), so it makes it impossible to load BridgePoint data
with the MC-3020 SQL loader. The original bug report can be seen at <<dr-4>>.

== 6 Unit Test

6.0 Import the model attached to the issue <<dr-3>> into a new workspace.

6.1 UI testing  +
6.1.1 Right click `op1`. Confirm that "Make Deferred..." CME is available.  +
6.1.2 Select "Make Deferred...", click Finish. Confirm that `op1` operations
appeared in classes `B` and `C`. With `A::op1` selected, confirm that the
deferral is viewable in properties and that the value for "Required" is
"Required".  +
6.1.3 Right click on `op2`. Confirm that "Make Deferred..." CME is _not_ available.  +
6.1.4 Right click on `class_based_op`. Confirm that "Make Deferred..." CME is _not_ available.  +
6.1.5 Right click on `subtype_op`. Confirm that "Make Deferred..." CME is _not_ available.  +
6.1.6 Right click on `op_no_rel`. Confirm that "Make Deferred..." CME is _not_ available.  +
6.1.7 Right click on `op3` and select "Make Deferred...". Confirm that the
dropdown box for "Relationship" contains both `R2` and `R3`. Select `R3`,
uncheck "Required", and click Finish. Navigate to the deferral in properties and
confirm that the value for "Required" is "Optional".  +
6.1.8 Right click on `E::op3` again and select "Make Local". Confirm that the
deferral disappears from the properties view.  +
6.1.9 Right click on `op_no_rel` again and select confirm that the "Make Local"
CME is _not_ available.  +

6.2 Ciera behavior test  +
6.2.1 Build the project by running `mvn install` in the project directory. +
Verify that it builds cleanly with no errors (no "FAIL" tests).  +
6.2.2 Run the project by running `bash run.sh` in the project directory. Confirm
that all tests pass.  +
6.2.3 Uncomment lines 44 and 45 in `init`. Build and run again. Confirm that an
error is thrown and the program exits. The error should look something like the
following:  +
```
No subtype selected
io.ciera.runtime.summit.exceptions.XtumlException: No subtype selected
...
```

== 7 User Documentation

Entries were added in the BridgePoint CME documentation for "Make Deferred..."
and "Make Local".
