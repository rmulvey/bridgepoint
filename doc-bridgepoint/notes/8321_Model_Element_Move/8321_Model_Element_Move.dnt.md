This issue shows an example where file system changes made by BridgePoint had a undesirable effect on a specific type of revision control system. The specified system was not really the relevant issue, though it was ClearCase. The issue was more general and was the fact the ClearCase system used pessimistic locking. The issue referenced because it is an example where the BridgePoint team handled this issue by modify the file system change so the RCS team interface would handle it in a more favorable way.  

3. Background   
-------------     

See the background in [the analysis note](../8031_Analyze_Model_Element_Move/8031_Analyze_Model_Element_Move.ant.md).

4. Requirements   
---------------   
The requirements are defined in this issue's [Statement of Work](#2.3). For convenience, 
the requirements defined in the SOW are being carried forward here. This design 
shall create some additional requirements based on the selected implementation. 
These additional requirements shall be placed after the last requirement copied  
from the SOW.  

4.1 Selected model elements are moved in a single operation that can be undone with 
a single undo operation.  

4.2 Within the limitations of the Eclipse Team interface, move operations are 
performed in a way that maximizes the probability of the underlying 
configuration-management system detecting that a move operation (as opposed 
to a sequence of delete and create operations) occurred.  

4.3 Model element move shall be supported for the following model elements 
(see Limitations [[2.3]](#2.3)):  
4.3.1 Data type definition  
4.3.2 Component definition  
4.3.3 Interface definition  
4.3.4 Class definition  
4.3.5 Component reference  
4.3.6 Imported class  
4.3.7 Package (when a package contains supported model elements)  

4.4 Whenever visibility permits, the connection between a moved model element 
and other model elements shall be maintained.  

For example, a data type can be moved without affecting the attributes and 
parameters typed by it so long as the data type remains visible to those 
elements typed by it.  

4.5 The model-element move capability is enabled only when all model 
elements within the current selection are supported model element types for 
the move capability.  

4.5.1 The option to move shall be present but disabled when a selection is 
not a valid move selection.  

4.6 Proxy paths are currently written inconsistently [[2.2](#2.2)]. This bug 
shall be resolved.

5. Analysis   
-----------   
See the [Analysis Note](../8031_Analyze_Model_Element_Move/8031_Analyze_Model_Element_Move.ant.md). 

In this analysis section we will add some additional proxy analysis. We do 
this because it is observed that there are multiple ways to perform the 
implementation for this task, and we want to assure we look at overall 
product roadmap as we perform this task to leverage the work to move us 
toward longer term product goals that may be related. Specifically, it 
is desirable to remove proxies.  

5.1 Choice of design options from the analysis note.

The option to use the existing infrastructure, [2.2](#2.2) section 5.3, shall 
be used. This option takes advantage of both the existing UI infrastructure and 
the infrastructure that is used to perform target selection and validation. 

5.1.1 Atomic transaction requirement

The analysis note, [2.2](#2.2), wrote that the choice to modify the implementation of 
the cut/paste operation such that IDs would not be changed would 
result in a transaction that was not atomic. This was true. However, the implementation 
proposed by this design will result in an atomic transaction. It will result 
in a move that adheres to the ACID properties of transactions. That is, 
the move implemented via cut/paste shall be atomic, consistent, isolated, 
and durable. 

5.1.2 Making the cut/paste (move) an ACID-compliant transaction in BridgePoint.

In this work we shall modify the cut/paste operation to be a single, 
long-lived transaction. It is referred to as long-lived because it survives
across multiple user operations (cut and paste). With this change, cut/paste is
analogous to move.

5.1.2.1 The move transaction shall not terminate until either:  
5.1.2.1.1 The paste is performed  
5.1.2.1.2 The transaction is terminated before paste is performed  
The move transaction shall be canceled if any other transaction is initiated
before the paste operation is completed.  

5.2 Proxy analysis with an eye to proxy removal  
Requirement 4.6 calls out a bug in proxy implementation. This design note shall describe
2 ways to resolve this problem. One way is proxy removal. This is the desired approach. 
This section provides an analysis of this proxy removal approach. The design section 
of this note describes how we will determine which approach to take.  

Section 1 of the [PLCM design note for proxies](i845-2.dnt) describes the BridgePoint 
proxy implementation.  

The BridgePoint NonRootModelElement.java class contains an operation, boolean isProxy(), 
used to determine if an in-memory instance is a proxy or not. To determine if the 
element is a proxy, it looks at the string attribute 
NonRootModelElement.java::m_contentPath and if that attribute is not null 
then the element is a proxy.  

Experience working with BridgePoint over the years has led the BridgePoint team 
to believe that the introduction of proxies when multi-file persistence (PLCM) 
was added to the tool was a mistake. Proxies were introduced with the idea 
that they would help validate the distributed files introduced during the PLCM
project. Additionally, the concept of lazy loading of model files was made 
possible by proxies and it was seen as a great benefit because users no longer
needed to wait for a model to load the first time a model element was opened.  

What the BridgePoint team believes, and has shown with tests of model load time, 
is that the amount of time to load a model, even a large model is not 
significant when compared to the architectural clutter at the persistence layer
introduced by proxies. Over time maintenance around proxy issues has been
high. Furthermore, it is observed even in the [original note that introduced 
proxies (section 3.3)](i845-PLCM_1_0.ant), that lazy-loading had limitations. 
Over time what has been observed is that lazy loading has done more harm 
than good.  

[[4.6](#4.6)] is a blocker to this issue because if 
proxies remain and are not persisted consistently the move operation will have 
failures caused by the inconsistent proxies paths. The following section 
examines proxy usage with an eye to the possibility of removing proxies 
as a solution to [[4.6](#4.6)]. Section 6.5 describes the steps to perform 
this removal.  

5.2.1 Proxy implemenation  
As described in the [PLCM design note for proxies](i845-2.dnt), proxies are 
implemented with the followed generated operations:  
*  `createProxy(..[all parameters].., String filePath)`  
Returns an instance.  
*  `resolveInstance(..[all parameters]..)`   
Searches, by UUID for a matching instance and returns the instance if found. If 
not found, creates a new instance.  
* `convertToProxy()`  
Convert a real instance to a proxy.
* `convertToRealInstance(..[all parameters]..)`  
Convert a proxy to a real instance.  

5.2.2.1 lazy loading  
Lazy loading policy provides that data for the parent (RTO) is not loaded unless
needed. However, in many cases immediate loading of parent data  
triggered. For example, a class diagram shows the type of its
attributes and so unless there are no attributes to display, the
corresponding data type data must be loaded. 

This issue shall take the position that maintenance and problems
around lazy loading support are not worthy of the feature benefits.  

5.2.2.2 Model Compare  
Model Compare and merge provides comparison of changes on a per-file basis. 
The comparison is not graphical, but it is structural based on the meta-model 
(it is more than a simple textual compare). This functionality has been modified 
quite a bit to add features and introduce bug fixes [2.9](#2.9). This feature 
does utilize proxies. Further analysis of the use of proxies by model compare 
and merge will be required in order to remove proxies from the tool. There 
were a lot of the features/fixes in this area, and will be easiest to 
analyze these further by removing the proxy functionality first.  Therefore, no
further analysis of this is done at this time.  

6. Design   
----------------   

As described in the analysis section, the copy/paste infrastructure shall be 
used in order to take advantage of it's ability to perform selection 
and target validation as well as minimize changes to the BridgePoint user 
interface. This section describes how we will modify this existing
infrastructure to change the behavior of cut/paste so that it is analogous with
move.  

6.1 Modify cut/paste operation to be analogous to "move" by making it a 
single long-lived transaction. This shall adhere to the ACID properties 
of transactions.  

6.1.1 The current infrastructure uses an abstract class, 
core/ui/CopyCutAction.java extends org.eclipse.jface.action.Action, 
to define the behavior of cut/copy operations this interface shall be modified 
to allow the cut/paste operation to be a single transaction as opposed to 2 
separate transactions. In addition to this abstract class, the classes that 
extend this shall also be modified as required for this change. These are:  
* `core/ui/CopyAction.java` - This shall be modified as needed to adhere to interface 
changes, but functionality shall not be changed.
* `core/ui/CutAction.java` - The deletion of selected elements will no longer be 
performed during cut. Instead, this deletion will be moved to the paste 
operation so that no change is actually made until paste occurs.  

6.2 Modify the paste action (`core/ui/PasteAction.java`).  

The copy/paste behavior shall not be changed during this change.  

The paste operation behavior is implemented in the generated 
file io/mdl/ImportModelStream.java (generated from `io/mdl/arc/gen_stream_import.arc`). 
The PasteAction.java class invokes this through the same BridgePoint 
interface that is used for all model element loading (`IModelImport.java`). 
`ImportModelStream` is used for model export as well as paste, therefore to introduce 
the ability to cause element load to use the source IDs instead of creating new ones
a flag will be introduced to indicate that cut/paste is being performed (as opposed 
to copy/paste). When cut/paste is indicated, the generated model element constructor 
calls will be made in a way that assures:  
6.2.1 The source element ID(s) shall be used and no new IDs shall be created  
6.2.2 The element is created in the target model root.  
6.2.3 The when model root(s) are included in the selection being moved, the paste 
action shall perform the move in a way that facilitates the ability of the team interface 
to handle the action as a move as opposed to a cut/paste (which would lose RCS history). 
This is where requirement 4.2 is handled.  
6.2.3.1 The implementation shall proceed by first modifying the in-memory instances without 
regard to the persistence layer. When this task is complete, the persistence layer is 
seperate, and in theory will require no addtional because, since IDs are not changed, if 
a file whose contents are identical is deleted and created the team interface should be 
able to manage this as a move [2.11](#2.11).  However, BridgePoint deals with 
these changes at the file system level, and it is for the provider to handle the team 
opertions appropriately. BridgePoint does not even directly ever communicate with the 
Eclipse team interface, with 1 expception (compare and merge - `bp/model/compare/contentmergeviewer/ModelContentMergeViewer.java`).  What BridgePoibt code
can, and has done to help facilite preferred RCS behavior is to assure that file operations 
are performed in the best order, and this issue shall seek to do this. An example of where 
was done in the past may be seen here [2.12](#2.12).  

6.2.4 Where deletion of elements is required (paste is performed to a different model root) 
the deletion of the source elements will occur. The deletion shall occur after the paste to
faciliate 6.2.3.  
6.2.5 An attempt to paste to the same location that the copy was made from is considered an 
invalid selection and shall not be allowed.  

6.3 Reuse the current tree view that shows Model Elements affected by the 
cut/paste operation  

6.3.1 The dialof shall allow the user to cancel   

6.3.2 In the type demotion dialog, consider adding text to tell the user to 
consider turning on IPRs or checking package visibility.  

6.3.3 As per the SOW [[2.3](#2.3)], the dialog needs to have save and print optons added.  

6.4 Modify all resolution operations to first search by ID  instead of name  

Section 6.2 of [[2.10](../8031_Analyze_Model_Element_Move/i3532.dnt)] describes 
how resolution operations were introduced to perform this search by ID. There 
should be no further action to take on this, but if testing shows otherwise, 
this is the pattern to follow to complete this task.

6.5 Fix inconsistent proxy paths [[2.4](#2.4)]  

It is desirable to resolve this problem by simply removing proxies from 
BridgePoint as described in the analysis section. However, doing so may 
be beyond the scope of this project. The primary concern is around unexpected 
consequences involving self hosting. However, it should not be difficult to 
perform a test of proxy removal, and the steps to do so shall be outlined here 
[6.5.1]. This task of resolving the inconsistent proxy paths is intentionally 
left as the last task in the project. If the attempt to remove proxies results
in unexpected problems that time constraints do not allow us to resolve then 
these problems shall be recored and we shall resolve this requirement by 
fixing the bug in the existing proxy code [6.5.2].

6.5.1 Remove proxies from BridgePoint  

6.5.1.1 Remove generated code used to read and write proxies  
* remove convertToProxy()
* Stop generating the operations that read/write proxies in:
  * `io.core/arc/import_functions.inc`
  * `io.core/arc/export_functions.inc`
  * `io.mdl/arc/gen_stream_import_.arc`
  * `io.mdl/arc/gen_stream_export_.arc`

6.5.1.2 Load the whole model at startup
```
// nrme is the NonRootModelElement associated with the SystemModel_c instance
PersistableModelComponent pmc = nrme.getPersistableComponent();
			pmc.loadComponentAndChildren(new NullProgressMonitor());
```  
6.5.1.3 Remove generation of convertFromProxy() and delayed problem marker code  
```java
    public void convertFromProxy() {
        if (isProxy()) {
            m_contentPath = null;
            UmlProblem.proxyResolved(this);
        }
    }
```  
6.5.1.4 Remove generation of `convertToRealInstance()`  
6.5.1.5 Remove generation of `createProxy()`  
6.5.1.6 Test and fix fallout of proxy removal on compare and merge  


6.5.2 Write proxy paths consistently  

If the proxy removal encounters problems then this path to 
resolve [[2.4](#2.4)] shall be taken. The proxy path is 
obtained by 
bp.core.util.PersistenceUtil.java::resolveRelativePath(currentPath, relativePath). 
This routine gets called by the createProxy() operation which is generated for all 
NonRootModelElements. The RSL for this is found in MC-Java/java.arc::createProxy 
(around line 743 you can find the call to resolveRelativePath()). This code will be
debugged and the problem found and fixed.  


7. Design Comments   
------------------   
none  


8. User Documentation   
---------------------  
8.1 This issue changes the behavior of cut/paste making it analogous to move. 
BridgePoint documenation shall be updated accordingly.  
8.1.1 The cut operation no longer causes any change. Whej cut is selected, no 
change occurs until and unless paste is performed.  
8.1.2 Unlike copy/paste which creates new elements on pase, the modified cut/paste operation leaves identifers intact.  
8.1.2.1 This means that while a copied buffer may be pasted muitple times, a cut buffer can be pasted only 1 time.  

9. Acceptance Test   
------------------  

Use cases for the tests below are found in the SOW [[2.3](#2.3)]. The unit test model(s) and use case implementations shall be further described by [[2.8](#2.8)].
 
9.1 Test to assure that the move operation is atomic  

9.2 Test to assure that the move operation maximizes the probability of the  
underlying configuration-management system detecting that the move within  
the limitations of the eclipse team interface.  

9.3 Test element move for each supported model element as specified in section 4.3. 

9.4 Test to assure that when visibility permits, the connection between a 
moved model element and other model elements shall be maintained.  

9.4.1 Test to assure that when visibility does not permit the connection between 
model elements to be maintained proper defaults are used.

9.5 Test to assure the model-element move capability is only enabled for 
valid model element selections and is present but disabled otherwise.

9.6 Assure that proxy paths are written consistently.  
Include use cases in this issue's test model(s) that cause the proxy path 
problems described by [[2.2](#2.2)]. Run these use cases to assure these 
problem are resolved.  

9.7 Assure that the user documenation has been updated (see section 8).
