= Rename of deployment component not complete

xtUML Project Implementation Note

== 1 Abstract

Issue <<dr-1>> shows a rename of a deployment where it was stated that instances
of the name in the xtuml file were left unchanged.

== 2 Introduction and Background

In examining the document provided by the issue reporter, it was noted that the
first unchanged instance was the keyletter field for the Deployment class.
Subsequent other unchanged instances in the provided documentation were places
that use the deployment name for the domain name to distinguish the terminator.

Renames in BridgePoint are handled throught the Context Menu Entry Functions
package in a function named, <class keyletters>_Rename. In complex rename
scenarios, the class will have its own rename method that is called.

Keyletters in BridgePoint default to the class name, and default keyletters 
should get updated if the class name changes.


== 3 Requirements

=== 3.1 Update default Deployment keyletters on a rename

== 4 Work Required

=== 4.1 Update default Deployment keyletters on a rename in code
. A method named, "rename", should be added to the Deployment class and action
  language to update the keyletters and the class name will be added.
. The new method will be called in place of existing action language in
  Context Menu Entry Functions::D_DEPL_Rename.

=== 4.2 Update default Deployment keyletters on a rename in unit test
. Change the
  bptest/src/org.xtuml.bp.core.test/src/org/xtuml/bp/core/test/ui/ContextMenuTestsGenerics.java
  testContextMenuRenameActionOnD_DEPL method to ensure the rename updates the
  D_DEPL::Key_Lett attribute, if defaulted.

=== 4.3 Update special Deployment as Domain Terminators on a rename in code
. Add code to find and update the Terminators using the Deployment name as the
  Domain name in the new Deployment::rename method

=== 4.4 Update special Deployment as Domain Terminators on a rename in unit test
. Add checks for Terminator updates in the unit test.

== 5 Implementation Comments

Existing action language for a keyletters rename was copied to ensure
consistency.

It was noted that there are other package elements (i.e., elements
with keyletters) that aren't updating default keyletters.

== 6 Unit Test

Core Test : RenameTest2Generics.java was updated to add the unit tests.
Model testRename1 was modified to add a Deployment for rename.

=== 6.1 Test Defaulted Key Letters Get Renamed On Element Rename

. Ensure the key letter value matches the element name sans spaces.
. Rename the element and check for the key letter value to match the new name
  sans spaces.

=== 6.2 Test Non-Defaulted Key Letters Don't Get Renamed On Element Rename

. Ensure the key letter value doesn't match the element name.
. Rename the element and check for the key letter value to not have changed.
