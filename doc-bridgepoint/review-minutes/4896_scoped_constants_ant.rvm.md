_- 02  min   LPS  3        Constants are not data types.  Fix this throughout.

_- 06  min   xxx  5.3      What about paths?
1) Qualifiers need to follow OAL identifier rules (no blanks).
2) Partial paths that resolve the tie are sufficient.
@Bob, There needs to be a left bracket before scoped_model and another after with a question mark.
_- 07  min   xxx  6.1      model name and/or package names [note plural].
_- 08  min   xxx  9        should be section 7
_- 09  min   xxx  9.5      Remove "fully qualified".

No major observations, a re-review is not required.
