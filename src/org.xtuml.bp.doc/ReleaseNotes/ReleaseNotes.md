| Category              | Requirement                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Operating System      | Windows 7/8/10, Linux variants       |
| *Eclipse              | Version 4.5                          |
| *Java Virtual Machine | Version 1.8 or later                 |

General Notes
------
* A summary of the release highlights and new functionality is available on the 
[What's New](../WhatsNew/WhatsNew.html) page.  
  
* __IMPORTANT__: BridgePoint 5.8 is a completely open source version of the software. 
Please see [xtUML.org](http://xtuml.org) and [onefact.net](http://onefact.net) 
for ongoing development and support of BridgePoint.  
  
* BridgePoint ships as a zip file, similar to standard eclipse packages. Users 
who wish to create desktop shortcuts to start BridgePoint should set the 
shortcut to start ```<install dir>/eclipse/Launcher.[sh|bat]```.  

* This version supports moving a model element via Cut & Paste.  The actual element
is moved and underlying UUIDs are not recalculated.  
  * Note that model elements that have connectors (associations, interfaces, etc) 
must be moved from the canvas because the graphical connectors do not appear in
Model Explorer.  The ```Cut``` menu item is disabled if the selection is incomplete.  
  * Move is supported for a specific list of model elements: Data type definition, 
Component definition, Interface definition, Class definition, Component reference, 
Imported class, Package (when package contains supported model elements)  

* BridgePoint 5.8 has enhanced support for modeling with the MASL action
language.  An Xtext-based editor provides syntax highlighting, validation
and context-sensitive edit assistance.  

* This version adds a new attribute ```Dialect``` in the metamodel to action 
homes that used to populate the ```Action_Semantics``` field.   

Interoperability with Previous Releases
------
BridgePoint 5.8.6 is compatible with workspaces and projects created with prior 
versions back to BridgePoint 5.0.  However, after opening the model in this version
a modeler will not be able to open the model in a prior version.
