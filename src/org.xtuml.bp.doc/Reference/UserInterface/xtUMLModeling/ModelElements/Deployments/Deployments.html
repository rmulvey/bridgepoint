<h2 id="_introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an xtUML model, components (also known as "domains") define a cohesive block of
functionality whose internal behavior may be defined by classes and state machines
or realized code in a target language.  Components communicate with one another
via interfaces that define messages that the component uses to access behavior from
other components or to declare behavior that the component itself provides for
other components to use.  This process of connecting components together is called
"wiring" or "bridging".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BridgePoint xtUML provides two mechanisms to accomplish this domain bridging. OAL
users have historically used the direct and graphical wiring together of interfaces
on component references. That approach does not use deployments as described here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deployments were added to accomplish bridging in a way that is more natural to modelers
using MASL/ASL. Deployments reference domain components by name rather than by
direct reference and graphical interconnections. This allows deployments to be edited
without requiring all associated domain projects to be in the workspace at the same
time.  Deployments are therefore separated and independent from the domain sources.
Component reference wiring, on the other hand, <em>does</em> require the associated domain
projects to be present in the workspace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The choice of which method to use is based on the needs of the user and choice of
model compiler the user is running to translate their model. The remainder of
this document focuses on the creation and use of deployments themselves.  Readers
are encouraged to read the documentation <a href="../../../SystemModeling/HTML/SystemModeling.htm">System-Level Modeling with Components</a>
and <a href="../../../../MASL/MASLConversionGuide/MASLConversionGuide.html">MASL Modeling and Conversion Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_editing_deployments">3. Editing deployments</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned previously, deployments are designed to maintain a separation and
independence from the domain sources. At the same time, deployments provide the
ability to be refreshed from the domain sources. To preserve this loose coupling
between the deployment and its source, but also ensure that the deployment stays
reasonably in sync with the source, deployments are designed so that very few
things are editable by the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the model of a deployment, a user may edit:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The name of the deployment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Description fields on deployments, terminators, terminator services, and
terminator service parameters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action semantics (action language) of terminator services</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Dialect of terminator services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation scope of terminator services</p>

</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everything else is not editable directly by the user, but must be edited in the
source (port message in a domain or <code>.int</code> or <code>.mod</code> file). Furthermore,
terminator services and terminator service parameters may not be deleted by the
user. Terminators and deployments may be deleted. Stale services may also be deleted
(see <a href="#stale_services">Stale services</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two different types of terminators are supported by deployments (Figure 4). Provided
terminators represent all of the public services (inbound API) of a particular
domain. These are named with the same name as the domain and appear brown in the
Model Explorer view. Services on provided terminators are automatically assigned the
"None" dialect. For MASL/ASL users, the dialect should always be "None" for provided services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Required terminators represent the terminators (outbound API) of a domain. They
are named with the name of the domain followed by <code>::</code> followed by the name of the
terminator itself as in: <code>Tracking::UI</code> and appear blue in the model explorer.
Services on required terminators are automatically assigned the dialect of the
source service or the workspace default dialect when necessary.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_implementation_scope">3.2. Implementation scope</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In MASL/ASL modeling, users require the ability to specify that a terminator service in
a deployment is implemented in native code. In this case, a declaration in the <code>.prj</code>
file is necessary, but a <code>.tr</code> definition file should not be produced. Alternatively,
to indicate the domain implementation is used, a terminator service may be excluded
from output entirely. In this case, no declaration is created in the <code>.prj</code> and no
definition in a <code>.tr</code> are produced. Table 1 lists effects of the various combinations
of the Implementation Scope and Dialect properties of terminator services.</p>

in domain components in packages named "scenarios".  Scenarios can be

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Terminator services and service parameters may refer to types which are not
xtUML core types. In order to maintain loose coupling between the source and the
deployment itself, new types must be created if they are not found within the
deployment project. The standard way type references are created for MASL is by
creating a new xtUML user data type and setting its core type to be <code>MASLtype</code>. Public
domain types referenced by project terminators must be qualified with the name
of the domain as in <code>UI::GoalCriteria</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The import mechanism searches for these types in a package called "Shared"
adjacent to the deployment itself. If they are not found, they are created.
<code>MASLtype</code> is expected to be in a package called "types" at the top level of
the model and is created if it is not found in that location.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_xtext_masl_dependencies">4.5. Xtext MASL dependencies</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dependencies on domain services and types can be defined in the <code>.dependencies</code>
file or by using the Dependencies editor from the "Project Preferences" CME. These
dependencies are used by the Xtext MASL editor to allow references to external
elements to be resolved in MASL action language. As a convenience feature, these
dependencies are automatically added to the <code>.dependencies</code> file when a provided
terminator is imported. With this automatic process, a modeler can immediately
start making invocations to provided terminator services from action language
once they are imported.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For terminators imported from a MASL file, an absolute path reference to the
selected file is added to the <code>.dependencies</code> file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For terminators imported from a component, a dependency on a file named
<code>&lt;Component_Name&gt;.int</code> adjacent to the component source (<code>.xtuml</code>) file is added
to the <code>.dependencies</code> file. This new dependency uses the <code>WORKSPACE_LOC</code>
substitution variable, so it is not an absolute filesystem path. This location
is the location where the <code>.int</code> file for the referenced domain will be
generated by the MASL refresher.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Terminators inside a deployment are refreshed when a user re-imports from a
component or domain interface file. Since the signature of a service is the
identifying key, it can be difficult to identify which service must be updated if
the signature changes. The approach of BridgePoint is conservative, trying to make
good decisions when safe while avoiding any loss of data.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="stale_services">5.1. Stale services</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to prevent action language from ever being wrongfully deleted, the
merge/refresh algorithm never deletes services but rather marks them as "stale"
if it thinks they may need to be removed. In the case of stale service being
created, the modeler must determine whether the service should be deleted or
whether the action language must be copied to the new version of the service.
Once the action language is copied, the stale service should be deleted.</p>
