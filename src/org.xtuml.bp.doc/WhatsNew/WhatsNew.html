<h2 id="masl-support-enhancements">MASL Support Enhancements</h2>
<p>This release includes many improvements to MASL support within the tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many updates to the MASL parser. Drastic reduction of false positive errors on valid syntax.<br />
</li>
<li>Improvements to Refactor/Rename</li>
<li>Marking and pragma support improvements</li>
<li>... and more. See the full list of resolved issues in the Release Notes</li>
</ul>
<p>This release also includes updated documentation in the MASL Modeling and Conversion Guide<br />
regarding use and creation of MASL-idiom features.</p>
<h2 id="document-generation-fixes">Document Generation Fixes</h2>
<p>BridgePoint's &quot;Create documentation&quot; feature is updated to work cleanly on Linux<br />
variants and MacOS. The feature now relies on system versions of the external <code>xsltproc</code> tool.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MS Windows</strong>: <code>xsltproc.exe</code> is included in the BridgePoint distribution, no<br />
additional steps are required.</li>
<li><strong>MacOS</strong>: <code>xsltproc</code> is included in the operating system software, no additional<br />
steps are required.</li>
<li><strong>Linux</strong>: <code>xsltproc</code> is included in some distributions and not in others. In a<br />
terminal window, type <code>$ which xsltproc</code>. If the tool is found, no additional steps are<br />
required. If the tool is not found, use your package manager (<code>apt-get</code> or <code>yum</code>) to install<br />
it. For example:<br />
<code>$ sudo apt-get install xsltproc</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-specific-bridgepoint-products">Task-specific BridgePoint Products</h2>
<p>The BridgePoint tool is modeled in xtUML and therefore BridgePoint is used to<br />
create BridgePoint. Most users simply wish to create xtUML applications and<br />
they do not need or want additional eclipse features to support BridgePoint<br />
tool development.</p>
<p>To simplify the user experience for application modelers, BridgePoint is now<br />
available in two different forms: xtUML Modeler and BridgePoint Developer.</p>
<p>The xtUML Modeler version of BridgePoint includes the smallest set of features<br />
needed for xtUML application editing, translating, and debugging.</p>
<p>The BridgePoint Developer version is a superset of the xtUML Modeler version. It<br />
adds additional eclipse features that support Java and Xtext code development<br />
and testing.</p>
<h2 id="macos-support">MacOS Support</h2>
<p>BridgePoint is now supported on MacOS.</p>
<p>Please note that the download for MacOS does not come with a JRE included. The tool<br />
relies on a JRE (version 8 or later) to already exist on the system.</p>
<p>Java installation <a href="https://java.com/en/download/help/mac_install.xml">instructions are here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure-improvements">Infrastructure Improvements</h2>
<p>This release also includes a number of enhancements to the internals of BridgePoint and<br />
the development infrastructure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use relate and unrelate of pyrsl in MC-3020</li>
<li>Use maven for consistent build approach locally and on build server</li>
<li>JUnit test cleanup and automated testing</li>
<li>Run multiple CLI command in a single instance of eclipse</li>
<li>Sample project creation hang fix</li>
<li>...and more. See the release notes.</li>
</ul>
