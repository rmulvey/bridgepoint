3. Background   
-------------     

See the background in [the analysis note](#2.4).

4. Requirements   
---------------   
The requirements are defined in this issue's [Statement of Work](#2.3).

5. Analysis   
-----------   
See the [Analysis Note](#2.4).  

5.1 Out-of-scope (downgradable) elements:  
1. Reference to a user defined type  
2. Interface reference  
3. Component reference  
4. Class refernce due to relationship  
5. Class reference held by imported class  
6. External Entity reference  
7. Parse of action language containing downgraded references.  

5.2 Places where a downgrade (scope change) occurs:  
1. Downgrade in source  
2. Downgrade in destination  


6. Design   
----------------   

6.1 See the [Design Note](#2.1).  


7. Test Cases  
------------------  
Every test case should be followed by an "Undo". The undo operation should 
leave all model files unchanged from before the move. The check for changes
should use a text-based difference tool. A good practice would be to test on a
clean checkout of the repository and let 'git diff' do the text compare.  
A finding of differences should be noted in the test results.  
Undo should be a single step. If multiple undo operations are required to 
recind the move, it should be noted as an error in the test case results.

7.14 Moving a Package (create a model from scratch)
  * 1.    Create a xtUML project
  * 2.    Create a package named P1 at top level

  * 10.   Paste into P3
  * 11.   P2 graphic at top level is gone, P2 graphic is added to P3
  * 12.   Restart BridgePoint

  * 11.   Formalize association R1 using Id
  * 12.   Cut CL2, should that be ok?
  * 13.   Paste in COMP1-P1
  * 14.   Graphic in COMP1-P1 is incorrect and probably the consistency of the model, Error!
  * 15.    
  * 16.   Alternate the Cut of CL2 with a Cut of CL1 should that be ok?
  * 17.   Paste in COMP1-P1
  * 18.   Graphic in COMP1-P1 is incorrect and probably the consistency of the model, Error!      

7.17  Data Type at top level within project (Uses test model [2.7](#2.7))
  * 1.   Cut My_DT from P1
  * 2.   Paste My_DT into P3
  * 3.   Check the attribute type of Attr in CL1 by opening the set type dialog of the attribute, path 7_17_Data_Type_at_top_level::P3 will be shown and data type 7_17_Data_Type_at_top_level::P3 will not be selectable in the dialog (Correct)
  * 4.   Restart BridgePoint
  * 5.   Check the attribute type of Attr in CL1 by opening the set type dialog of the attribute, path will be empty and data type 7_17_Data_Type_at_top_level::P3 will be selectable in the dialog (Fail). Now it looks like that the data type is incorrect.
  * 6.   Look into the p3.xtuml and cl1.xtuml files and find the instances of S_DT for My_DT and for O_ATTR of Attr, find out that the correct data type is assigned to the attribute
  * 7.   The model is correct but the editor does not show the correct information. 

7.18 Data type inside component (Uses test model [2.7](#2.7))
  * 1. Create a new UDT named My_DT2 inside COMP1

  * 1. Create a new xtUML project named TestProj2
  * 2. Create a new package PKG2 inside TestProj2
