= Relationship Editor

xtUML Project Analysis Note

== 1 Abstract

Want to automatically formalize relationships when they are drawn and force the
user to set up referentials and role phrases at creation time.

This issue originates from a November 17, 2018 discussion between users and
the BridgePoint engineering team regarding high-priority work items.

== 2 Introduction and Background

One difference between BridgePoint and iUML highlighted at xtUML Days 2017 is
UI work flows. BridgePoint tends to provide an editing experience that focuses
on individual model changes -- renaming, adding elements, changing individual
property values of model elements. iUML focuses on more cohesive editing actions
-- creating an attribute includes specifying its type, optionally adding it to
an identifier, etc. Creating a relationship includes formalizing the
relationship, specifying cardinality and role phrases, etc. iUML does not allow
users to create an attribute and then add it to an identifier; these are done in
one action. Model elements may be edited after the fact, but it is always in the
context of the larger modeling action. Users have expressed preference for the
more cohesive work flow approach.

== 3 Requirements

=== 3.1 Formalization at Creation
BridgePoint shall support formalizing associations at relationship creation time.

==== 3.2.1 Formalization Configuration
This mechanism may be enabled or disabled through a workspace preference.

=== 3.2 Standards Enforcement
The auto-formalization mechanism shall support enforcement of certain modeling standards.

==== 3.2.1 Enforcement Configuration
The enforcement rules may be configured through workspace preferences.

==== 3.2.2 Role Phrase Configuration
Role phrases may be configured to be required or optional.

=== 3.3 Default Values
Reasonable defaults shall be provided for all new workspace preferences.

== 4 Analysis

=== 4.1 Workflow Support

BridgePoint currently uses a mechanism to generate UI workflows as Eclipse
wizards. Actions that require multiple inputs or steps can be defined using a
combination of PEI data and special OAL functions. Invocations to a special EE
("User") are used to map to user interactions such as selecting elements from a
drop down menu or entering text. Archetypes generate wizard implementations and
menu entries based on the PEI data and parsed OAL instances. This mechanism can
be reused to easily create a variety of operations. It could also be modified to
generate any flavor of UI element. For example, instead of wizards, it could be
changed to support a workflow in a single dialog or even an editor pane.

=== 4.2 Element Creation

During element creation, special OOA of OOA functions are invoked to initialize
a new element. These functions could be used to hook into existing UI workflows.
In this way a particular workflow can be automatically initiated on creation of
an element. This could be controlled by a preference.

=== 4.3 Workflow Generation Pitfalls

A full relationship editor is quite a bit more complex than any UI workflow so
far in BridgePoint. This section enumerates the shortcomings of the generation
process and where it would need to be changed to support such a workflow.

==== 4.3.1 Model Data/Generation Coupling

Over time the archetypes used to generate UI workflows have become strongly
coupled to the data used to generate those workflows. The result is a generation
flow which is very specific to the current UI workflows. For example, some of the labels
for the relationship formalization actions are hard coded directly into the
archtypes. This makes the workflow generation considerably less flexible for use
with new workflows.

==== 4.3.2 Handwritten Code

In addition to <<4.3.1 Model Data/Generation Coupling>>
for some of the more complex workflows, handwritten code is
required for certain pages of the wizards. This can potentially be a Good
Thing from the perspective of adding new workflows, as it adds flexibility to the
mechanism, however it means that less of the code is generated than would be
ideal.
